## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important: Stremio Version Limitation

This extension is confirmed to work perfectly with the stable **Stremio v4**.

Due to a bug in the beta version of Stremio, this extension **does not currently work with Stremio v5 Beta**. The v5 Beta fails to correctly handle the external `stremio://` links that this extension generates. A bug report has been filed, and this notice will be removed if the issue is resolved in a future Stremio update.

#### **Step 2: Unzip the Folder**

-   Find the downloaded ZIP file (e.g., `mal-to-stremio-extension-main.zip`) in your Downloads.
-   Right-click and **"Extract All..."** or **"Unzip"** the contents.
-   Place the resulting folder somewhere permanent on your computer where you won't delete it by accident (e.g., your Documents folder).

#### **Step 3: Load the Extension in Your Browser**

1.  Open your browser and navigate to its extensions management page. The address is slightly different for each browser:
    -   **Brave:** `brave://extensions`
    -   **Chrome:** `chrome://extensions`
    -   **Edge:** `edge://extensions`

2.  In the top-right corner of the extensions page, find the **"Developer mode"** toggle and make sure it is switched **ON**. This will reveal new buttons.
